# GitHub - Branches and Pull Requests

## Introduction

Now that the group project is coming up it is important to practice using tools like Git. When working together in large groups it is important to be able to test out different things in the project without being afraid of ruining the code. This is where git branches come in handy and forking a GitHub repository and making a pull request can have the same result.

## Forking

This method is better for teams that want to work more independently and gives the group more control over the code and a easy way of doing code reviews. It can on the other hand take longer to get new code into the main repository and there fore the coding process might be slower

## Branching

This method is better for teams that want to be able to get their code quickly together so that each member of the team can see the changes he made immediately. It can on the other hand become a bit confusing in larger teams and harder to have overview of what is happening and requires there fore more communication between members of the team.

# Our Team Project

### Collaborative work effortness of unity

Due to the nature of this project you will need to find someone to work with. It is alright if you are more than two people in a group and in fact you can have as many people in your group as you like, the whole class can work together on this if you like.
The group (two or more students) needs to do the following (do all of this together in person or through Zoom):

## PART ONE - FORK & PULL REQUEST:

• One student (here by referred to as The Mother) creates a repository with a few files
• For example readme.md, index.html, style.css and main.js
• The other students then do the following:
• Fork the repository (on the GitHub page)
• Clone the code from your own GitHub repository (the fork)
• Make some interesting changes to the code
• Push the new code to your own repository
• Make a pull request on the GitHub website
• The Mother now needs to accept the changes on the website too

## PART TWO - BRANCHES:

• Now The Mother needs to invite all the other students as collaborators to the repository
• The students will then receive an email where they need to accept the collaboration
• The students will then need to do the following:
• Clone the mothers repository (not the fork) to their own computer
• Make a new branch in the recently cloned repository
• Make sure that you are working on the new branch
• Make some changes to the code
• Switch to master (or main) branch
• Observe that your changes are not there anymore
• Merge the new branch into master/main
• Push the new code to GitHub
• Observe the new code in GitHub
• Now make a new branch again and make sure you are working on it
• Make some changes to the code again.
• Push the code by using git push origin xxxxxx where xxxxxx is the name of your branch
• The Mother now needs to do the following:
• Pull the new changes and check out the new branches from the other students
• Observe that the changes are there each time you check out a new branch
• Check out the master/main branch
• Merge the other branches into master/main
• Push the code to GitHub
